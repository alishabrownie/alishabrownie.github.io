    <h1>Interactive Experience <br>Research Project</h1>
    <h2>Luniverse Website Experience</h2>


    <h3>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
    <p>My attention was drawn to the dreamy, pastel purple background and how this contrasted with the more vibrant colours of the floating objects. I was interested in what the objects on the floating platforms represented. The screen moved with my cursor and the objects lifted in the air when hovered over, conveying that the interactive nature of the website. The large “Luniverse” title fading into the background also gave an ethereal feeling to the website which could tie in with how the website is presented like a galaxy with the floating “planets” portraying the different apps of the company.</p>

    <h3>3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
    <p>During the experience I spent the most time doing a combination of playing around with the interactive elements and reading through information about the company and its apps. I found it intriguing to figure out which components I could interact with and testing their limits. This also helped to me to engage with the experience and think about how each section’s visuals correlated with their respective apps, prompting me to want to find out more information. There wasn’t an extensive amount to play with, so it was clear that the main goal of the experience wasn’t a game and that these elements were more introductory and symbolic. Navigating further into the site and scrolling through the descriptions of the apps helped me to understand what the Luni company involved.</p>

    <h3>4. What was the most common action in your two-minute interaction with the experience?</h3>
    <p>The most common action that occurred was clicking with my cursor to interact with animated elements and navigate to different sections. I enjoyed the liveliness of the animations, and they were satisfying to play with, enhancing an explorative quality within the experience. Clicking to navigate into different areas of the website allowed me to read more information on the company, the apps they create and the jobs they offer to the user.</p>

    <h3>5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
    <p>The intended primary goal of the interactive experience seems to be to express the purpose, branding and creativity of the Luni Company in order to invite people to explore job opportunities with them. As a first impression, Luni might want to communicate the fun, innovative nature of the company with captivating designs to compel users to apply to work with them. From the list of jobs in the Talent Centre, Luni appears to want to attract job seekers in the app design and development field. Its main aim is most likely to give them clear view of the Luniverse and its apps and to provide a platform where they can easily apply to work with the company.</p>

    <img class="luni8" src="image/luni8.png" width="550" alt="join luni team">

    <h3>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h3>
    <p>Each section uses captivating, interactive visuals that draw the user in. The interactivity of the floating objects encourages users to engage more with the website, likely resulting in them being more interested in the information that it provides later in the experience. After deciding to discover more information about a certain app, each section consistently has buttons that take the user to the “Talent Centre” where they can apply to work with Luni. There is also a “Talent Centre” button on the top right in the header that stays as you scroll through each section, always giving the user the opportunity to navigate to where they can apply. The text also often uses inclusive language and talks to the user directly, using vocabulary like “we,” “let’s,” and “you,” enforcing the idea that Luni wants the user to join them and be part of the team. Each app description has large, concise paragraphs and captivating images to accompany them. This would appeal to their audience of job seekers because they likely look at a lot of different companies for work and want to be able to easily understand what Luni does and avoid reading massive amounts of text.</p>

    <h3>7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
    <p>•	The title/starting pages for each app would most likely only be interacted with once upon first visiting the site for a short amount of time to engage the user and leave a good first impression to motivate them to want to know more about the company. <br>
      •	The discover pages that stem each page would be visited a few times to get a sense of the different types of apps that Luni make so that job applicants can have a good understanding of what they do. <br>
      •	Users might also look at the job descriptions multiple times to figure out if it fits them well and to help them decide if they want to apply. <br>
      •	This website is likely aimed for short-term engagement as there is no new information or interactivity added if you revisit the site. Its main purpose would be to learn what the company is about and decide to apply for a job or not. After this is achieved the user would likely not feel the need/desire to return to the website. <br>

    <h3>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
    <p>When you first enter the website, there are moving, interactive elements and there is text that invites the user to scroll to explore Luniverse. The first instinct is to interact and explore with the website and gather information on what it is about. After acquiring this knowledge, the user can see in the top right that there is a drop-down bar to more easily navigate the site and a button that leads to a list of jobs that they are hiring for. So now the user can utilise this to go to each section to clarify information and decide if they want to apply for a position.</p>

    <h3>9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
    <p>The experience references space and a galaxy-like setting, depicted by the platforms floating in the ombre background, similar to planets in space. This could connect to the reasoning behind the “Luniverse” name because the website represents a universe for the company that the user can explore. The objects on the home page being lifted as you hover over each one also reminds me of zero gravity which further conveys this concept.</p>

    <h3>10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <p>The galaxy inspiration invites the user to explore the website like a world in a game. It encourages them to visit each “planet” in the Luniverse and interact with their playful elements while discovering information about each one. This is further emphasised by the caption on the home page that says “Scroll to explore the Luniverse.”</p>
    <img class="luni13" src="image/luni13.png" width="400" alt="we are luni caption">

    <h3>11. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h3>
    <p>The universe reference could help the users to feel excited and curious when engaging with the experience, prompting them to feel the same way about the Luni company and what they do.  It could make the experience more fun for users rather than just simple descriptions of apps, assisting in immersing the user in the work the company does so they are inclined to want to join it.</p>

    <h3>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h3>
    <p>I initially found it confusing to understand what the website was about. Each title page has little information on what the visuals are showing, and I did not grasp the idea that they were representing different apps at first. The design of the website and its interactivity made it seem more like a game rather than a place to find information on the Luni Company.  It was frustrating having that lack of clarity at the beginning and not knowing what I was looking at, especially because the captions on the homepage were quite vague. This could drive off potential job applicants who misinterpret the site as more of a gamified experience rather than a website to explore the company.</p>

    <h3>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h3>
    <p>Being able to interact with the visuals was satisfying because it made exploring each section of the site more engaging as I could find more elements to play with as I navigated further into the website. It was satisfying to have that aspect of interactivity consistently throughout the website because it helped to keep my attention, as well as comminate what each app focuses on through the different types of objects. The style of these visuals and how their pops of bright colour contrast with the pastel colour backgrounds was also very cohesive throughout the website, which made the experience very visually pleasing.</p>
